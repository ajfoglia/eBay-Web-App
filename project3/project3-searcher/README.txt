Academic Honesty

I used this link to help with writing an XML file: 
http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-create-xml-file-in-java-dom/

I followed the general pattern of that to create my DOM structure and properly format my XML.

I also used lots of online documentation regarding Document, SearchResult, and ScoreDoc types.

**********************************************************

basicSearch:
Made use of ScoreDoc and SearchResult types. Used online documentation to determine how to make sense of results. My code is commented and pretty self-explanatory. I followed the online tutorial pretty closely as well.

spatialSearch:
Had all the tools I needed after creating the index and another table, but just could not figure out how to use geometry to pinpoint whether the location was valid. Made this problem a lot tougher than it needed to be but I got it to work.

getXMLFromItemId:
Originally wasted a lot of time creating a carefully formatted string until Luis tipped me off to use the Project2 API, which made things a lot easier. Basic idea was to create Element items, set their attributes if necessary and keep appending nodes to create an XML structure. Provided library functions helped with this. I left my original solution that just made a massive string in my code, so there are a ton of unnecessary comments but I didn't have time to throughly test my new version of this function so I wanted to preserve that in case my newer solution fails at all. I adhered closely to the link above when writing my XML file because I had no experience with it before. I tried to write my own code though.
