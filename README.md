# eBay-Web-App

Built a web service and web site that allows users to search and navigate eBay bidding data. The bidding data is from XML files. The project supports browsing and searching interfaces over the Internet while also managing the data in MySQL at the back-end in a database that I designed. The main technologies involved were  Java, MySQL, JSP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Other web development tools involved included Tomcat, Apache, Axis2 and SOAP.
